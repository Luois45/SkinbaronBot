### Usage
#### You must login yourself after starting the bot the first time

#### Just enter the details of what you wanna buy into the "searches" list
#### The bot will buy these things automatically if it is finding a matching offer
#### You can also create a "advanced" search which is calculating the float which the item has to match for buying. This can be handy if you want to buy weapons for trade-ups automatically.
#### The "searches" are preconfigured so that it will buy things by itself after you logged yourself in if you aren't changing the searches
#### The preconfiguration is made to buy cheap items
